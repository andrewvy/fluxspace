### Websocket-based MUD Library / Game in Elixir

---

This is a mudlib implemented in Elixir, with a custom entity-component
framework based off of [Entice](https://github.com/entice/entice).

Read the internal docs: https://github.com/andrewvy/fluxspace/tree/master/docs

We use custom vm flags for the server CLI:

Use `./start` for starting the server.
